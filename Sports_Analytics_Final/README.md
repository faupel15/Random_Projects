This was my final project for my Sports Analytics elective in my Masters program, in which I explored March Madness games since 2014 based on the Game Excitement Index (GEI). 
The primary goal of this analysis was to determine which games were the most exciting and determine what factors may lead to a more exciting NCAA tournament game.

An RMarkdown file contains the code used, and a PDF file contains the final report I submitted.
